        Galen Marek, also known as Starkiller, is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe. He is the protagonist of The Force Unleashed game and its sequel.
        The Force Unleahed game's creators used a variety of methods in designing the character. These included looking at pictures of young actors and bodybuilders for inspiration, as well as using their own ideas about what would make for an interesting character.
        The creative team behind the game had to work with a number of constraints. They had to create a character that felt like he could have been part of the original trilogy, and they wanted him to be completely different from Darth Vader. The team also wanted him to be an anti-hero, so he needed to have some redeeming qualities.
        The creative team for the game was given an idea for a character that was driven by revenge and anger, but they did not know how this would translate into gameplay or visuals.

      <h3>Biography and character development</h3>
      <p>
        
        The game is about a darksider who has been corrupted by the dark side of the force. His name is Galen Marek, also known as Starkiller. He had been trained by Darth Vader and Palpatine to become an agent of their Galactic Empire and to help them rule over the galaxy.
        He was created by John Jackson Miller, who used him as an explanation of what would have happened if Luke Skywalker had turned to the dark side.
        Galen Marek was born on Kashyyyk to a mother who died in childbirth and a father who was killed by Darth Vader for refusing to divulge information about the location of other Jedi. Galen was then taken from his home planet by Vader to be trained as his secret apprentice in the ways of the Sith.
        Galen Marek is one of the few characters with no previous Star Wars canon background (excluding those from Legends). He is the first Jedi in star wars Legends that had appeared with no connection with the Skywalker Saga aside from being the protoge of Darth Vader.
        Galen's past is shrouded by mystery, but one thing is certain: he was the apprentice to Darth Vader. One fateful day on Kashyyyk, Galen Marek attempted to assassinate his master in a fit of anger after learning of his true lineage: that he had been created in the bowels of an Imperial lab as part of Project Harvester. But before he could deliver the killing blow, Vader sensed his betrayal and fought back with ferocity. The two engaged in a ferocious duel that continued through the halls and ended atop the high branches of a wroshyr tree deep in the heart of Wookiee territory far from any civilization. It is unknown how long or how deadly their struggle was before it finally ended with both combatants falling from great heights onto solid ground

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>
        
        In this game, the developers tried to push the boundaries by creating a new form of combat system that allows players to take on waves of enemies and position themselves strategically in combat.
        He is voiced by Sam Witwer who also played Darth Maul in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Maul's clones in the season two of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels.
        He is one of the few Star Wars characters who could use Force Lightning- a powerful bolt of energy that can be used to attack enemies at close range.
        Even though primiarly a Sith Chracter becuase of his noble lineagle he also has access to force powers and abilities only seen in Jedi.
        Marek is capable of using Force powers such as telekinetic attacks, mind tricks, and lifting objects with his mind alone. But he's also proficient in using Sith techniques such as Force lightning and Force Grip from his father's teachings.
