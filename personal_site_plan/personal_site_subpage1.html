            <p>The best equipment for river rafting is a good quality, well-fitting lifejacket. A life jacket can save you from drowning if you fall into the water or are swept away by strong currents, and it will also keep you afloat in case of an accident. You should wear two layers of clothing when river rafting: one layer on top (a light windproof jacket) and another layer underneath (a waterproof/breathable jacket). Wear gloves, long pants and closed shoes to protect yourself against sharp rocks and thorns that may be found along the riversides.</p>
