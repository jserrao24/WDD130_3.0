            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>The game is about a darksider who has been corrupted by the dark side of the force. His name is Galen Marek, also known as Starkiller. He had been trained by Darth Vader and Palpatine to become an agent of their Galactic Empire and to help them rule over the galaxy. He was created by John Jackson Miller, who used him as an explanation of what would have happened if Luke Skywalker had turned to the dark side. Galen Marek was born on Kashyyyk to a mother who died in childbirth and a father who was killed by Darth Vader for refusing to divulge information about the location of other Jedi. Galen was then taken from his home planet by Vader to be trained as his secret apprentice in the ways of the Sith. Galen Marek is one of the few characters with no previous Star Wars canon background (excluding those from Legends). He is the first Jedi in star wars Legends that had appeared with no connection with the Skywalker Saga aside from being the protoge of Darth Vader. Galen's past is shrouded by mystery, but one thing is certain: he was the apprentice to Darth Vader. One fateful day on Kashyyyk, Galen Marek attempted to assassinate his master in a fit of anger after learning of his true lineage: that he had been created in the bowels of an Imperial lab as part of Project Harvester. But before he could deliver the killing blow, Vader sensed his betrayal and fought back with ferocity. The two engaged in a ferocious duel that continued through the halls and ended atop the high branches of a wroshyr tree deep in the heart of Wookiee territory far from any civilization. It is unknown how long or how deadly their struggle was before it finally ended with both combatants falling from great heights onto solid ground  </p>
