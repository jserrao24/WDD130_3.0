            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>In this game, the developers tried to push the boundaries by creating a new form of combat system that allows players to take on waves of enemies and position themselves strategically in combat. He is voiced by Sam Witwer who also played Darth Maul in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Maul's clones in the season two of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels. He is one of the few Star Wars characters who could use Force Lightning- a powerful bolt of energy that can be used to attack enemies at close range. Even though primiarly a Sith Chracter becuase of his noble lineagle he also has access to force powers and abilities only seen in Jedi. Marek is capable of using Force powers such as telekinetic attacks, mind tricks, and lifting objects with his mind alone. But he's also proficient in using Sith techniques such as Force lightning and Force Grip from his father's teachings.  </p>
