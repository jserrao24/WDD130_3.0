            <p> Galen Marek, also known as Starkiller, is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe. He is the protagonist of The Force Unleashed game and its sequel.
                The Force Unleahed game's creators used a variety of methods in designing the character. These included looking at pictures of young actors and bodybuilders for inspiration, as well as using their own ideas about what would make for an interesting character.</p>

            <p>      The creative team behind the game had to work with a number of constraints. They had to create a character that felt like he could have been part of the original trilogy, and they wanted him to be completely different from Darth Vader. The team also wanted him to be an anti-hero, so he needed to have some redeeming qualities.
                The creative team for the game was given an idea for a character that was driven by revenge and anger, but they did not know how this would translate into gameplay or visuals.</p>
